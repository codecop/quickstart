patched the `ClassOrInterfaceRefactor` from walkmod-refactor-plugin to identify used classes by full package.
Currently `refactor` does not recognise usages of the old class in the same package.

Exchange the file in `$HOME/.ivy2/cache/org.walkmod/walkmod-refactor-plugin/jars/walkmod-refactor-plugin-2.3.3.jar`
